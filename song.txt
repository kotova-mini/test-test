Polly wants a cracker. Think I should get off her first.
I think she wants some water. To put out the blow torch. It isn't me.

(Chorus) We have some seed. Let me clip. Your dirty wings.
Let me take ride. Don't hurt yourself. I want some help.
To help myself. I've got some rope. You have been told.
I promise you. I have been true. Let me take a ride.
Don't hurt yourself. I want some help. To help myself.

Polly wants a cracker. Maybe she would like more food.
She asks me to untie her. A chase would be nice for a few.
